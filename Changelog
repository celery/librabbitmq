.. _version-1.0.1:

- ``queue_unbind`` argument ``binding_key`` renamed to ``routing_key``
  (Issue #16).

    This change ensures compatibility with :mod:`amqp`.

- Fixed memory leak caused by double call to ``AMQPTable_toPyDict``
  (Issue #15).

    Fix contributed by Eric Siegel.

- Fixed several potential memory leaks (Issue #15).

    Fix contributed by Marcus Cobden.

- Removed `-ansi` compile option (Issue #17).

.. _version-1.0.0:

1.0.0
=====
:release-date: 2012-11-02 5:00 P.M UTC

- A channel exception will now cause the channel to be revived instead of
  simply closing the connection.

- Support for lists and dictionaries in header values.

    This also means that the RabbitMQ `Bcc` and `CC` header extensions now can
    be constructured.

    Contributed by C Anthony Risinger.

- Support for float/double in header values.

- Adds dummy ``nowait`` argument to ``queue_delete`` for amqplib API
  compatibility (it has no effect).

- Library errors now use the correct error strings (Issue #7).

.. _version-0.9.9:

0.9.9
=====
:release-date: 2012-07-23 08:50 P.M BST

- More llvm-gcc fixes for OS X.

.. _version-0.9.8:

0.9.8
=====
:release-date: 2012-07-23 07:10 P.M BST

- Fixes bug when compiled using :program:`llvm-gcc` on OS X (Issue #5).

.. _version-0.9.7:

0.9.7
=====
:release-date: 2012-07-23 02:30 P.M BST

- Connection and channel errors now close the connection,
  so that connection/channel cannot be used.

    Before an operation on a connection/channel that previously raised
    an exception would just hang.

    In the future it may be possible to have channel errors only close
    the channel, but this keeps it simple for now (and it works like amqplib).

.. _version-0.9.6:

0.9.6
=====
:release-date: 2012-06-13 11:25 P.M BST

- Fixes problem with basic_publish and kombu.

.. _version-0.9.5:

0.9.5
=====
:release-date: 2012-06-07 12:20 P.M BST

- Now supports 'arguments' for:

    - basic_consume
    - exchange_declare
    - queue_declare
    - queue_bind
    - queue_unbind

- Release buffers after every command, so that memory
  does not grow on operations like ``basic_cancel``.

- Now uses buffer instead of PyString_Join.

- basic_consume now returns consumer tag.

- Now compiles with -Wall -ansi -pedantic.

- The message callback is now called from the C stack,
  so that drain_events does not return control back to the Python interpreter.

  Calling the callback from the same stack as slurping the socket enables
  us to pass the memory directly to the callback as a buffer object.

- When receiving messages we now only allocate memory once for single frame
  payloads.

    For multiple frames we no longer create temporary PyString's,
    but instead just memcpy the contents to a single string buffer.

- Adds amqp methods:

    - basic_cancel
    - flow
    - recover

- Now using array.array to keep track of unused channel id's.

- Internally the C Connection object now consistently have the channel
  as the first argument for all channel related methods.

- Fixed compiler warning in basic.qos

- frame_max, channel_max and heartbeat values are now updated
  to the values received from connection_tune_ok.

- basic_recv now raises socket.timeout directly, so that don't
  have to reraise.

- Unicode support.
